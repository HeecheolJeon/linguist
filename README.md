Linguist
========

An AI running on [NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic) using the CLA to build a model of language, and predict the rest of a user's word, phrase, sentence.

The current application works as a "story teller", it'll train on a dataset you give it and then produce a story for you. You can specify number of sentences the story
should have and the starting words to kick it off (for example, "There were two brothers").

## Reference

The CLA learns sentences letter-by-letter, we'd like to observe if grammatical features can emerge. See [Jeff Hinton's text-generation deep NNs](https://class.coursera.org/neuralnets-2012-001/lecture/91) for reference and inspiration.

Usage
========

First, install [NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic).

Then, run:

    python client/linguist.py data/tiny.txt

It'll run on the tiny.txt dataset, feeding it the sentence over and over again, printing out Linguist's next 10 timestep predictions at each step.

After it finishes training, it will enter "story teller" mode.
